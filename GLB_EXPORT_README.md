# GLB Export Functionality for blend_gaussians.py

## Overview

I have successfully modified the `blend_gaussians.py` script to generate GLB files in addition to MP4 videos. The script now exports both `gaussians.glb` and `gaussians_blended.glb` files alongside the existing MP4 outputs.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Import
```python
from trellis.utils import postprocessing_utils
```

### 2. Added GLB Export Function
A new function `gaussian_to_glb()` was added that converts Gaussian representations to GLB files:

```python
def gaussian_to_glb(gaussian: Gaussian, output_path: str, simplify: float = 0.95, texture_size: int = 1024):
    """
    Convert a Gaussian representation to a GLB file.
    
    Args:
        gaussian (Gaussian): The Gaussian representation to convert
        output_path (str): Path where to save the GLB file
        simplify (float): Ratio of triangles to remove in simplification
        texture_size (int): Size of the texture used for the GLB
    """
```

### 3. Modified Main Function
Added GLB export calls in the `merge_gaussians()` function:

- **Vanilla Scene**: After generating `gaussians.mp4`, the script now also generates `gaussians.glb`
- **Blended Scene**: After generating `gaussians_blended.mp4`, the script now also generates `gaussians_blended.glb`

## Implementation Details

The GLB export function uses a two-step approach:

1. **Primary Method**: Creates a mesh from Gaussian points using Delaunay triangulation
2. **Fallback Method**: If triangulation fails, creates a point cloud representation using small spheres

### Dependencies Required

The GLB export functionality requires:
- `trimesh` - for mesh creation and GLB export
- `scipy.spatial.Delaunay` - for triangulation
- `numpy` - for array operations

## Usage

The functionality is automatically enabled when running the `merge_gaussians()` function. No additional parameters are needed.

### Example Output Files

When running the script, you will now get:
- `gaussians.mp4` - Original video
- `gaussians.glb` - Original scene as GLB
- `gaussians_blended.mp4` - Blended video  
- `gaussians_blended.glb` - Blended scene as GLB

## Error Handling

The implementation includes robust error handling:
- Graceful fallback if mesh creation fails
- Detailed error messages for debugging
- Continues execution even if GLB export fails

## Testing

A test script `test_glb_export.py` was created to verify the functionality. To run it:

```bash
python test_glb_export.py
```

## Notes

- The GLB files are created using a simplified mesh extraction approach
- For production use, you may want to implement more sophisticated mesh extraction from Gaussians
- The current implementation creates basic meshes suitable for visualization
- GLB files can be opened in most 3D viewers and web browsers

## Future Improvements

1. **Better Mesh Extraction**: Implement proper mesh extraction from Gaussian splats
2. **Texture Baking**: Add texture baking from Gaussian colors
3. **LOD Support**: Add level-of-detail support for large scenes
4. **Compression**: Add GLB compression options
